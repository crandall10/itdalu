Facing 
Up 
to 
the 
Problem 
of 
Consciousness
Introduction
Consciousness 
poses 
the 
most 
baffling 
problems 
in 
the 
science 
of 
the 
mind 
There 
is 
nothing 
that 
we 
know 
more 
intimately 
than 
conscious 
experience 
but 
there 
is 
nothing 
that 
is 
harder 
to 
explain 
All 
sorts 
of 
mental 
phenomena 
have 
yielded 
to 
scientific 
investigation 
in 
recent 
years 
but 
consciousness 
has 
stubbornly 
resisted 
Many 
have 
tried 
to 
explain 
it 
but 
the 
explanations 
always 
seem 
to 
fall 
short 
of 
the 
target 
Some 
have 
been 
led 
to 
suppose 
that 
the 
problem 
is 
intractable 
and 
that 
no 
good 
explanation 
can 
be 
given
To 
make 
progress 
on 
the 
problem 
of 
consciousness 
we 
have 
to 
confront 
it 
directly 
In 
this 
paper 
I 
first 
isolate 
the 
truly 
hard 
part 
of 
the 
problem 
separating 
it 
from 
more 
tractable 
parts 
and 
giving 
an 
account 
of 
why 
it 
is 
so 
difficult 
to 
explain 
I 
critique 
some 
recent 
work 
that 
uses 
reductive 
methods 
to 
address 
consciousness 
and 
argue 
that 
these 
methods 
inevitably 
fail 
to 
come 
to 
grips 
with 
the 
hardest 
part 
of 
the 
problem 
Once 
this 
failure 
is 
recognized 
the 
door 
to 
further 
progress 
is opened 
In 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
paper 
I 
argue 
that 
if 
we 
move 
to 
a 
new 
kind 
of 
nonreductive 
explanation 
a 
naturalistic 
account 
of 
consciousness 
can 
be 
given
I 
put 
forward 
my 
own 
candidate 
for 
such 
an 
account 
a 
nonreductive 
theory 
based 
on 
principles 
of 
structural 
coherence 
and 
organizational 
invariance 
and 
a 
double-aspect 
view
of 
information
The 
Easy 
Problems 
and 
the 
Hard 
Problem
There 
is 
not 
just 
one 
problem 
of 
consciousness
Consciousness 
is 
an 
ambiguous 
term 
referring 
to 
many 
different 
phenomena 
Each 
of 
these 
phenomena 
needs 
to 
be 
explained 
but 
some 
are 
easier 
to 
explain 
than 
others 
At 
the 
start 
it 
is 
useful 
to 
divide 
the 
associated

The 
problems 
of 
consciousness 
into 
hard 
and 
easy 
problems 
The 
easy 
problems 
of 
consciousness 
are 
those 
that 
seem 
directly 
susceptible 
to 
the 
standard 
methods 
of 
cognitive 
science 
whereby 
a 
phenomenon 
is 
explained 
in 
terms 
of 
computational 
or 
neural 
mechanisms 
The 
hard 
problems 
are 
those 
that 
seem 
to 
resist 
those 
methods
The 
easy 
problems 
of 
consciousness 
include 
those 
of 
explaining 
the 
following 
phenomena
the 
ability 
to 
discriminate 
categorize 
and 
react 
to 
environmental 
stimuli
the 
integration 
of 
information 
by 
a 
cognitive 
system
the 
reportability 
of 
mental 
states
the 
ability 
of 
a 
system 
to 
access 
its 
own 
internal 
states
the 
focus 
of 
attention
the 
deliberate 
control 
of 
behavior
the 
difference 
between 
wakefulness 
and 
sleep
All 
of 
these 
phenomena 
are 
associated 
with 
the 
notion 
of 
consciousness 
For 
example 
one 
sometimes 
says 
that 
a 
mental
state 
is 
conscious 
when 
it 
is 
verbally 
reportable 
or 
when 
it 
is 
internally 
accessible 
Sometimes 
a 
system 
is 
said 
to 
be 
conscious 
of 
some 
information 
when 
it 
has 
the 
ability 
to 
react 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
that 
information 
or 
more 
strongly 
when 
it 
attends 
to 
that 
information 
or 
when 
it 
can 
integrate 
that 
information 
and 
exploit 
it 
in 
the 
sophisticated 
control 
of 
behavior 
We 
sometimes 
say 
that 
an 
action 
is 
conscious 
precisely 
when 
it 
is 
deliberate 
Often 
we 
say 
that 
an 
organism 
is 
conscious 
as 
another 
way 
of 
saying 
that 
it 
is 
awake
There 
is 
no 
real 
issue 
about 
whether 
these 
phenomena 
can 
be 
explained 
scientifically 
All 
of 
them 
are 
straightforwardly 
vulnerable 
to 
explanation 
in 
terms 
of 
computational 
or 
neural 
mechanisms 
To 
explain 
access 
and 
reportability 
for 
example 
we 
need 
only 
specify 
the 
mechanism 
by 
which 
information 
about 
internal 
states 
is 
retrieved 
and 
made 
available 
for 
verbal 
report 
To 
explain 
the 
integration 
of 
information 
we 
need 
only 
exhibit 
mechanisms 
by 
which 
information 
is 
brought 
together 
and 
exploited 
by 
later 
processes 
For 
an 
account 
of 
sleep 
and 
wakefulness 
an 
appropriate 
neurophysiological 
account 
of 
the 
processes 
responsible 
for 
organisms 
contrasting 
behavior 
in 
those 
states 
will 
suffice 
In 
each 
case 
an 
appropriate 
cognitive 
or 
neurophysiological 
model 
can 
clearly 
do 
the 
explanatory 
work
If 
these 
phenomena 
were 
all 
there 
was 
to 
consciousness 
then 
consciousness 
would 
not 
be 
much 
of 
a 
problem 
Although 
we 
do 
not 
yet 
have
anything 
close 
to 
a 
complete 
explanation 
of 
these 
phenomena 
we 
have 
a 
clear 
idea 
of 
how 
we 
might 
go 
about 
explaining 
them 
This 
is 
why 
I 
call 
these 
problems 
the 
easy 
problems 
Of 
course 
easy 
is 
a 
relative 
term 
Getting 
the
details 
right 
will 
probably 
take 
a 
century 
or 
two 
of 
difficult 
empirical 
work 
Still 
there 
is 
every 
reason 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
methods 
of 
cognitive 
science 
and 
neuroscience 
will 
succeed 
The 
really 
hard 
problem 
of 
consciousness 
is 
the 
problem 
of 
experience 
When 
we 
think
and 
perceive 
there 
is 
a 
whir 
of 
information-processing 
but 
there 
is 
also 
a 
subjective 
aspect 
As 
Nagel 
(1974) 
has 
put 
it 
there 
is 
something 
it 
is 
like 
to 
be 
a 
conscious 
organism 
This 
subjective 
aspect 
is 
experience 
When 
we 
see 
for 
example 
we 
experience 
visual 
sensations 
the 
felt 
quality 
of 
redness 
the 
experience 
of 
dark 
and 
light 
the 
quality 
of 
depth 
in 
a 
visual 
field 
Other 
experiences 
go
along 
with 
perception 
in 
different 
modalities 
the 
sound 
of 
a 
clarinet 
the 
smell 
of 
mothballs 
Then 
there 
are 
bodily 
sensations 
from 
pains 
to 
orgasms 
mental
images
that 
are 
conjured 
up 
internally 
the 
felt 
quality 
of 
emotion 
and 
the 
experience 
of 
a 
stream 
of 
conscious 
thought 
What 
unites 
all 
of 
these 
states 
is 
that 
there 
is 
something 
it 
is 
like 
to 
be 
in 
them 
All 
of 
them 
are 
states 
of 
experience
It 
is 
undeniable 
that 
some 
organisms 
are 
subjects 
of 
experience 
But 
the 
question 
of 
how 
it 
is 
that 
these 
systems 
are 
subjects 
of 
experience 
is 
perplexing 
Why 
is 
it 
that 
when 
our 
cognitive 
systems 
engage 
in 
visual 
and 
auditory 
information-processing 
we 
have 
visual
or 
auditory 
experience 
the 
quality 
of 
deep 
blue 
the 
sensation 
of 
middle-C 
How 
can 
we 
explain 
why 
there 
is 
something 
it 
is 
like 
to 
entertain 
a 
mental 
image 
or 
to 
experience 
an 
emotion 
It 
is 
widely 
agreed 
that 
experience 
arises 
from 
a 
physical 
basis 
but 
we 
have 
no 
good
explanation 
of 
why 
and 
how 
it 
so 
arises 
Why 
should 
physical 
processing 
give 
rise 
to 
a 
rich 
inner 
life 
at 
all 
It 
seems 
objectively 
unreasonable 
that 
it 
should 
and 
yet 
it 
does
If 
any 
problem 
qualifies 
as 
the 
problem 
of 
consciousness 
it 
is 
this 
one 
In 
this 
central 
sense 
of 
consciousness 
an 
organism 
is 
conscious 
if 
there 
is 
something 
it 
is 
like
to 
be 
that 
organism 
and 
a 
mental 
state 
is 
conscious 
if 
there 
is 
something 
it 
is 
like 
to 
be 
in 
that 
state 
Sometimes 
terms 
such 
as 
phenomenal 
consciousness 
and 
qualia 
are 
also 
used 
here 
but 
I 
find 
it 
more 
natural 
to 
speak 
of 
conscious 
experience 
or 
simply 
experience 
Another 
useful 
way 
to 
avoid 
confusion 
used 
by 
e.g. 
Newell 
1990 
Chalmers 
1996 
is 
to 
reserve 
the 
term 
consciousness 
for 
the 
phenomena 
of 
experience 
using 
the 
less 
loaded 
term 
awareness 
for 
the 
more 
straightforward 
phenomena 
described 
earlier 
If 
such 
a 
convention 
were 
widely 
adopted 
communication 
would 
be 
much 
easier 
as 
things 
stand 
those 
who 
talk 
about 
consciousness 
are 
frequently 
talking 
past 
each 
other
The 
ambiguity 
of 
the 
term 
consciousness 
is 
often 
exploited 
by 
both 
philosophers 
and 
scientists 
writing 
on 
the 
subject 
It 
is 
common 
to 
see 
a 
paper 
on 
consciousness 
begin 
with 
an 
invocation 
of 
the 
mystery 
of 
consciousness 
noting 
the 
strange 
intangibility 
and 
ineffability 
of 
subjectivity 
and 
worrying 
that 
so 
far 
we 
have 
no 
theory 
of 
the 
phenomenon 
Here 
the 
topic 
is 
clearly 
the 
hard 
problem
the 
problem 
of 
experience 
In 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
paper 
the 
tone
becomes 
more 
optimistic 
and 
the 
author 
own 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
is 
outlined 
Upon 
examination 
this
theory 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
a 
theory 
of 
one 
of 
the 
more 
straightforward 
phenomena
of 
reportability 
of 
introspective 
access 
or 
whatever 
At 
the 
close 
the 
author 
declares 
that 
consciousness 
has 
turned 
out 
to 
be 
tractable 
after 
all 
but 
the 
reader 
is 
left 
feeling 
like 
the 
victim 
of 
a 
bait-and-switch 
The 
hard 
problem 
remains 
untouched
Functional 
Explanation
Why 
are 
the 
easy 
problems 
easy 
and 
why 
is 
the 
hard 
problem 
hard 
The 
easy 
problems 
are 
easy 
precisely 
because 
they 
concern 
the 
explanation 
of 
cognitive 
abilities 
and 
functions 
To
explain 
a 
cognitive 
function 
we 
need 
only 
specify 
a 
mechanism 
that 
can 
perform 
the 
function 
The 
methods 
of 
cognitive 
science 
are 
well-suited 
for 
this 
sort 
of 
explanation 
and 
so 
are 
well-suited 
to 
the 
easy 
problems 
of 
consciousness 
By 
contrast 
the 
hard 
problem 
is 
hard 
precisely 
because 
it 
is 
not 
a 
problem 
about 
the 
performance 
of 
functions 
The 
problem 
persists 
even 
when 
the 
performance 
of 
all 
the 
relevant 
functions 
is 
explained 
Here 
function 
is 
not 
used 
in 
the 
narrow 
teleological 
sense 
of 
something 
that 
a 
system 
is 
designed 
to 
do 
but 
in 
the 
broader 
sense 
of 
any 
causal 
role 
in 
the 
production 
of 
behavior 
that 
a 
system 
might 
perform
To 
explain 
reportability 
for 
instance 
is 
just 
to 
explain 
how 
a 
system 
could 
perform 
the 
function 
of 
producing 
reports 
on 
internal 
states 
To 
explain 
internal 
access 
we 
need 
to 
explain 
how 
a 
system 
could 
be 
appropriately 
affected 
by 
its 
internal 
states 
and 
use 
information 
about 
those 
states 
in 
directing 
later 
processes 
To 
explain 
integration 
and 
control 
we 
need 
to 
explain 
how 
a 
systems 
central 
processes 
can 
bring 
information 
contents 
together 
and 
use 
them 
in 
the 
facilitation 
of 
various 
behaviors 
These 
are 
all 
problems 
about 
the 
explanation 
of 
functions
How 
do 
we 
explain 
the
performance 
of 
a 
function 
By 
specifying 
a 
mechanism 
that 
performs 
the 
function 
Here 
neurophysiological 
and 
cognitive 
modeling 
are 
perfect 
for 
the 
task 
If 
we 
want 
a 
detailed 
low-level 
explanation 
we 
can 
specify 
the 
neural 
mechanism 
that 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
function 
If 
we 
want 
a 
more 
abstract 
explanation 
we 
can 
specify 
a 
mechanism
in 
computational 
terms 
Either 
way 
a 
full
and 
satisfying 
explanation 
will 
result 
Once
we 
have 
specified 
the 
neural 
or 
computational 
mechanism 
that 
performs 
the 
function 
of 
verbal 
report 
for 
example 
the 
bulk 
of 
our 
work 
in 
explaining 
reportability 
is 
over
In 
a 
way 
the 
point 
is 
trivial 
It 
is 
a 
conceptual 
fact 
about 
these 
phenomena 
that 
their 
explanation 
only 
involves 
the 
explanation 
of 
various 
functions 
as 
the 
phenomena 
are 
functionally 
definable 
All 
it 
means 
for 
reportability 
to 
be 
instantiated 
in 
a 
system 
is 
that 
the 
system 
has 
the 
capacity 
for 
verbal 
reports 
of 
internal 
information 
All 
it 
means 
for 
a 
system 
to 
be 
awake 
is 
for 
it 
to 
be 
appropriately 
receptive 
to 
information 
from 
the 
environment 
and 
for 
it
to 
be 
able 
to 
use 
this 
information 
in 
directing 
behavior 
in 
an 
appropriate 
way 
To 
see 
that 
this 
sort 
of 
thing 
is 
a 
conceptual 
fact 
note 
that 
someone 
who 
says 
you 
have 
explained 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
verbal 
report 
function 
but 
you 
have 
not 
explained 
reportability 
is 
making 
a 
trivial 
conceptual 
mistake 
about 
reportability 
All 
it 
could 
possibly 
take 
to 
explain 
reportability 
is 
an 
explanation 
of 
how 
the 
relevant 
function 
is 
performed 
the 
same 
goes 
for 
the 
other 
phenomena 
in 
question
Throughout 
the 
higher-level 
sciences 
reductive 
explanation 
works 
in 
just 
this 
way 
To 
explain 
the 
gene 
for 
instance 
we 
needed 
to 
specify 
the 
mechanism 
that 
stores 
and 
transmits 
hereditary 
information 
from 
one 
generation 
to 
the 
next 
It 
turns 
out 
that 
DNA 
performs 
this 
function 
once
we 
explain 
how 
the 
function 
is 
performed 
we 
have 
explained 
the 
gene 
To 
explain 
life 
we
ultimately 
need 
to 
explain 
how 
a 
system 
can 
reproduce 
adapt 
to 
its 
environment 
metabolize 
and 
so 
on 
All 
of 
these 
are 
questions
about 
the 
performance 
of 
functions 
and 
so 
are 
well-suited 
to 
reductive 
explanation 
The 
same 
holds 
for 
most 
problems 
in 
cognitive 
science 
To 
explain 
learning 
we 
need 
to 
explain 
the 
way 
in 
which 
a 
systems 
behavioral 
capacities 
are 
modified 
in 
light 
of 
environmental 
information 
and 
the 
way 
in 
which 
new 
information 
can 
be 
brought 
to 
bear 
in 
adapting 
a 
systems 
actions 
to 
its 
environment 
If 
we 
show 
how 
a 
neural 
or 
computational 
mechanism 
does 
the 
job 
we 
have 
explained 
learning 
We 
can 
say 
the 
same 
for 
other 
cognitive 
phenomena 
such 
as 
perception 
memory 
and 
language 
Sometimes 
the 
relevant 
functions 
need 
to 
be 
characterized
quite 
subtly 
but 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
insofar 
as 
cognitive 
science 
explains 
these 
phenomena 
at 
all 
it 
does 
so 
by 
explaining 
the 
performance 
of 
functions
When 
it 
comes 
to 
conscious 
experience 
this 
sort 
of 
explanation 
fails 
What 
makes 
the 
hard 
problem 
hard 
and
almost 
unique 
is 
that 
it 
goes 
beyond 
problems 
about 
the 
performance 
of 
functions 
To 
see 
this 
note 
that 
even 
when 
we 
have 
explained 
the 
performance 
of 
all 
the 
cognitive 
and 
behavioral 
functions 
in 
the 
vicinity 
of 
experience
perceptual 
discrimination 
categorization 
internal 
access 
verbal 
report
there 
may 
still 
remain 
a 
further 
unanswered 
question 
Why 
is 
the 
performance 
of 
these 
functions 
accompanied 
by 
experience 
A 
simple
explanation 
of 
the 
functions 
leaves 
this 
question 
open
There 
is 
no 
analogous 
further 
question 
in 
the 
explanation 
of 
genes 
or 
of 
life 
or 
of 
learning 
If 
someone 
says 
I 
can 
see 
that 
you
have 
explained 
how 
DNA 
stores 
and 
transmits 
hereditary 
information 
from 
one 
generation 
to 
the 
next 
but 
you 
have 
not 
explained 
how 
it 
is 
a 
gene 
then 
they 
are 
making 
a 
conceptual 
mistake 
All
it 
means 
to 
be
a 
gene 
is 
to 
be 
an 
entity 
that 
performs 
the 
relevant 
storage 
and 
transmission 
function 
But 
if 
someone 
says 
I
can 
see 
that 
you 
have 
explained 
how
information 
is 
discriminated 
integrated 
and 
reported
but
you
have 
not 
explained 
how 
it 
is 
experienced 
they 
are 
not 
making 
a 
conceptual 
mistake 
This 
is 
a 
nontrivial 
further 
question
This 
further 
question 
is 
the 
key 
question 
in 
the 
problem 
of 
consciousness 
Why 
doesnt 
all 
this 
information-processing
go 
on 
in 
the 
dark 
free 
of 
any 
inner 
feel 
Why 
is 
it 
that 
when 
electromagnetic 
waveforms 
impinge 
on 
a 
retina 
and 
are 
discriminated 
and 
categorized 
by 
a 
visual 
system
this 
discrimination 
and 
categorization 
is 
experienced 
as 
a 
sensation 
of 
vivid 
red 
We 
know 
that 
conscious 
experience 
does 
arise 
when 
these 
functions 
are 
performed 
but 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
it 
arises 
is 
the 
central 
mystery 
There 
is 
an 
explanatory 
gap 
a
term 
due 
to 
Levine 
1983 
between 
the 
functions 
and 
experience 
and 
we 
need 
an 
explanatory 
bridge 
to 
cross 
it 
A 
mere 
account 
of 
the 
functions 
stays 
on 
one 
side 
of 
the 
gap 
so 
the 
materials 
for 
the 
bridge 
must 
be 
found 
elsewhere
This 
is 
not 
to 
say 
that 
experience 
has 
no 
function 
Perhaps 
it 
will 
turn 
out 
to 
play 
an 
important 
cognitive 
role
But 
for 
any 
role 
it 
might 
play 
there 
will 
be 
more 
to 
the 
explanation 
of 
experience 
than 
a 
simple 
explanation 
of 
the 
function 
Perhaps 
it 
will 
even 
turn 
out 
that 
in 
the 
course 
of 
explaining 
a 
function 
we 
will 
be 
led 
to 
the 
key 
insight 
that 
allows 
an 
explanation 
of 
experience 
If 
this 
happens 
though 
the 
discovery 
will 
be 
an 
extra 
explanatory 
reward 
There 
is 
no 
cognitive 
function 
such 
that 
we 
can 
say 
in 
advance 
that 
explanation 
of 
that 
function 
will 
automatically 
explain 
experience
To 
explain 
experience 
we 
need 
a 
new 
approach 
The 
usual 
explanatory 
methods 
of 
cognitive 
science 
and 
neuroscience 
do 
not 
suffice 
These 
methods 
have 
been 
developed 
precisely 
to 
explain 
the 
performance 
of 
cognitive 
functions 
and 
they 
do 
a 
good 
job 
of 
it 
But 
as 
these 
methods 
stand 
they 
are 
only 
equipped 
to 
explain 
the 
performance 
of 
functions 
When 
it 
comes 
to 
the 
hard 
problem 
the 
standard 
approach 
has 
nothing 
to 
say
Some
Case-studies
In 
the 
last 
few 
years 
a 
number 
of 
works 
have 
addressed 
the 
problems 
of 
consciousness 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
cognitive 
science 
and 
neuroscience 
This 
might 
suggest 
that 
the 
analysis 
above 
is 
faulty 
but 
in 
fact 
a 
close 
examination 
of 
the 
relevant 
work 
only 
lends 
the 
analysis 
further 
support 
When 
we 
investigate 
just 
which 
aspects 
of 
consciousness 
these 
studies 
are 
aimed 
at 
and 
which 
aspects 
they 
end 
up 
explaining 
we 
find 
that 
the 
ultimate 
target 
of 
explanation 
is 
always 
one 
of 
the 
easy 
problems 
I 
will 
illustrate 
this 
with 
two 
representative 
examples
The 
first 
is 
the 
neurobiological 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
outlined 
by 
Crick 
and 
Koch 
1990
see 
also 
Crick 
1994 
This 
theory 
centers 
on 
certain 
35
to
75 
hertz 
neural 
oscillations 
in
the 
cerebral 
cortex 
Crick 
and 
Koch 
hypothesize 
that 
these 
oscillations 
are 
the 
basis 
of 
consciousness 
This 
is 
partly 
because 
the 
oscillations 
seem 
to 
be 
correlated 
with 
awareness 
in 
a 
number 
of 
different 
modalities
within 
the 
visual 
and 
olfactory 
systems 
for 
example
and 
also 
because 
they 
suggest 
a 
mechanism 
by 
which 
the 
binding 
of 
information 
contents 
might 
be 
achieved 
Binding 
is 
the 
process 
whereby 
separately 
represented 
pieces 
of 
information 
about 
a 
single 
entity 
are 
brought 
together 
to 
be 
used 
by 
later 
processing 
as 
when 
information 
about 
the 
color 
and 
shape 
of 
a 
perceived 
object 
is 
integrated 
from 
separate 
visual 
pathways 
Following 
others 
e.g. 
Eckhorn 
et 
al 
1988 
Crick 
and 
Koch 
hypothesize 
that 
binding 
may 
be 
achieved 
by 
the 
synchronized 
oscillations 
of 
neuronal 
groups 
representing 
the 
relevant 
contents 
When 
two 
pieces 
of 
information 
are 
to 
be 
bound 
together 
the 
relevant 
neural 
groups 
will 
oscillate 
with 
the 
same 
frequency 
and 
phase
The 
details 
of 
how 
this 
binding 
might 
be 
achieved 
are 
still 
poorly 
understood 
but 
suppose 
that 
they 
can 
be 
worked 
out 
What 
might 
the 
resulting 
theory 
explain 
Clearly 
it 
might 
explain 
the 
binding 
of 
information 
contents 
and 
perhaps 
it 
might 
yield 
a 
more 
general 
account 
of 
the 
integration 
of 
information 
in 
the 
brain 
Crick 
and 
Koch 
also 
suggest 
that 
these 
oscillations 
activate 
the 
mechanisms 
of 
working 
memory 
so 
that 
there 
may 
be 
an 
account 
of 
this 
and 
perhaps 
other 
forms 
of 
memory 
in 
the 
distance 
The 
theory 
might 
eventually 
lead 
to 
a 
general 
account 
of 
how 
perceived 
information 
is 
bound 
and 
stored 
in 
memory 
for 
use 
by 
later 
processing
Such 
a 
theory 
would 
be 
valuable 
but 
it 
would 
tell 
us 
nothing 
about 
why 
the 
relevant 
contents 
are 
experienced 
Crick 
and 
Koch 
suggest 
that 
these 
oscillations 
are 
the 
neural 
correlates 
of 
experience 
This 
claim 
is 
arguable
does 
not 
binding 
also 
take 
place 
in 
the 
processing 
of 
unconscious 
information
but 
even 
if 
it 
is 
accepted 
the 
explanatory 
question 
remains 
Why 
do 
the 
oscillations 
give 
rise 
to 
experience 
The 
only 
basis 
for 
an 
explanatory 
connection 
is 
the 
role 
they 
play 
in 
binding 
and 
storage 
but 
the 
question 
of 
why 
binding 
and 
storage 
should 
themselves 
be 
accompanied 
by 
experience 
is 
never 
addressed 
If 
we 
do 
not 
know 
why 
binding 
and 
storage 
should 
give 
rise 
to 
experience 
telling 
a 
story 
about 
the 
oscillations 
cannot 
help 
us 
Conversely 
if 
we 
knew 
why 
binding 
and 
storage 
gave 
rise 
to 
experience 
the 
neurophysiological 
details 
would 
be 
just 
the 
icing 
on 
the 
cake 
Crick 
and 
Kochs 
theory 
gains 
its 
purchase 
by 
assuming 
a 
connection 
between 
binding 
and 
experience 
and 
so 
can 
do 
nothing 
to 
explain 
that 
link
I 
do 
not 
think 
that 
Crick 
and 
Koch 
are 
ultimately 
claiming 
to 
address 
the 
hard 
problem 
although 
some 
have 
interpreted 
them 
otherwise 
A 
published 
interview 
with 
Koch 
gives 
a 
clear 
statement 
of 
the 
limitations 
on 
the 
theorys 
ambitions
Well
lets
first 
forget 
about 
the 
really 
difficult 
aspects 
like 
subjective 
feelings 
for 
they 
may 
not 
have 
a 
scientific 
solution 
The 
subjective 
state 
of 
play 
of 
pain 
of 
pleasure 
of 
seeing 
blue 
of 
smelling 
a 
rose
there 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
huge 
jump 
between 
the 
materialistic 
level 
of 
explaining 
molecules 
and 
neurons 
and 
the 
subjective 
level 
Lets 
focus 
on 
things 
that 
are 
easier 
to 
study
like 
visual 
awareness 
Youre 
now 
talking 
to 
me 
but 
youre 
not 
looking 
at 
me 
youre 
looking 
at 
the 
cappuccino 
and 
so 
you 
are 
aware 
of 
it 
You 
can 
say 
Its 
a 
cup 
and 
theres 
some 
liquid 
in 
it
If 
I 
give 
it 
to 
you 
youll
move
your 
arm 
and 
youll 
take 
it
youll 
respond 
in 
a 
meaningful 
manner 
Thats 
what 
I 
call 
awareness
The 
second 
example 
is 
an 
approach 
at 
the 
level 
of 
cognitive 
psychology 
This 
is 
Bernard 
Baars
global 
workspace 
theory 
of 
consciousness
presented 
in 
his 
book 
A 
Cognitive 
Theory 
of 
Consciousness
According 
to 
this 
theory
the 
contents
of 
consciousness 
are 
contained 
in 
a 
global 
workspace
a 
central 
processor 
used 
to 
mediate 
communication 
between 
a 
host 
of 
specialized 
nonconscious 
processors 
When 
these 
specialized 
processors 
need 
to 
broadcast 
information 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
system
they 
do 
so 
by 
sending 
this 
information 
to 
the 
workspace
which 
acts 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
communal 
blackboard 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
system 
accessible 
to 
all 
the 
other 
processors
Baars
uses 
this 
model 
to 
address 
many 
aspects 
of 
human 
cognition
and 
to 
explain 
a 
number 
of 
contrasts 
between 
conscious 
and 
unconscious 
cognitive 
functioning 
Ultimately 
however 
it 
is 
a 
theory 
of 
cognitive 
accessibility 
explaining 
how 
it 
is 
that 
certain 
information 
contents 
are 
widely 
accessible 
within 
a 
system
as 
well 
as 
a 
theory 
of 
informational 
integration 
and 
reportability
The 
theory 
shows 
promise 
as 
a 
theory 
of 
awareness
the 
functional 
correlate 
of 
conscious 
experience
but 
an 
explanation 
of 
experience 
itself 
is 
not
on 
offer
One 
might 
suppose 
that 
according 
to 
this 
theory
the 
contents 
of 
experience 
are 
precisely 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
workspace 
But 
even 
if 
this 
is 
so 
nothing 
internal 
to 
the 
theory 
explains 
why 
the 
information 
within 
the 
global 
workspace 
is 
experienced
The 
best 
the 
theory 
can 
do 
is 
to 
say 
that 
the 
information 
is 
experienced 
because 
it 
is 
globally 
accessible 
But 
now 
the 
question 
arises
in 
a 
different 
form 
why 
should 
global 
accessibility 
give 
rise 
to 
conscious 
experience 
As 
always 
this 
bridging 
question 
is 
unanswered
Almost 
all 
work 
taking 
a 
cognitive 
or 
neuroscientific 
approach 
to 
consciousness 
in 
recent 
years 
could 
be 
subjected 
to 
a 
similar 
critique 
The 
Neural 
Darwinism 
model 
of 
Edelman 
1989 
for 
instance 
addresses 
questions 
about 
perceptual 
awareness 
and 
the 
self-concept 
but 
says 
nothing 
about 
why 
there 
should 
also 
be 
experience 
The 
multiple
drafts 
model 
of 
Dennett 
1991 
is 
largely 
directed 
at 
explaining 
the 
reportability 
of 
certain 
mental 
contents 
The 
intermediate 
level 
theory 
of 
Jackendoff 
1988 
provides 
an 
account 
of 
some
computational 
processes 
that 
underlie 
consciousness 
but 
Jackendoff 
stresses 
that 
the 
question 
of 
how 
these 
project 
into 
conscious 
experience 
remains 
mysterious
Researchers 
using 
these 
methods 
are 
often 
inexplicit 
about 
their 
attitudes 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
conscious 
experience 
although 
sometimes 
they 
take 
a 
clear 
stand 
Even 
among 
those 
who 
are 
clear 
about 
it 
attitudes 
differ 
widely 
In 
placing 
this 
sort 
of 
work 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
experience 
a 
number 
of 
different 
strategies 
are 
available 
It 
would 
be 
useful 
if 
these 
strategic 
choices 
were 
more 
often 
made 
explicit
The 
first 
strategy 
is 
simply 
to 
explain 
something 
else 
Some 
researchers 
are 
explicit 
that 
the 
problem 
of 
experience 
is 
too 
difficult 
for 
now 
and 
perhaps 
even 
outside 
the 
domain 
of 
science 
altogether 
These 
researchers 
instead 
choose 
to 
address 
one 
of 
the 
more 
tractable 
problems 
such 
as 
reportability 
or 
the 
self-concept 
Although 
I 
have 
called 
these 
problems 
the 
easy 
problems 
they 
are 
among 
the 
most 
interesting 
unsolved 
problems 
in 
cognitive 
science 
so 
this 
work 
is 
certainly 
worthwhile 
The 
worst 
that 
can 
be 
said 
of 
this 
choice 
is 
that 
in 
the 
context 
of 
research 
on 
consciousness 
it 
is 
relatively 
unambitious 
and 
the 
work 
can 
sometimes 
be 
misinterpreted
The 
second 
choice 
is 
to 
take 
a 
harder 
line 
and 
deny 
the 
phenomenon 
Variations 
on 
this 
approach 
are 
taken 
by 
Allport 
1988 
Dennett 
1991 
Wilkes 
1988 
According 
to 
this 
line 
once 
we 
have 
explained 
the 
functions 
such 
as 
accessibility 
reportability 
and 
the 
like 
there 
is 
no 
further 
phenomenon 
called 
experience 
to 
explain 
Some 
explicitly 
deny 
the 
phenomenon 
holding 
for 
example 
that 
what 
is 
not 
externally 
verifiable 
cannot 
be 
real 
Others 
achieve 
the 
same 
effect 
by 
allowing 
that 
experience 
exists 
but 
only 
if 
we 
equate 
experience 
with 
something 
like 
the 
capacity 
to 
discriminate 
and 
report 
These 
approaches 
lead 
to 
a 
simpler 
theory 
but 
are 
ultimately 
unsatisfactory 
Experience 
is 
the 
most 
central 
and 
manifest 
aspect 
of 
our 
mental 
lives 
and 
indeed 
is 
perhaps 
the 
key 
explanandum 
in 
the 
science 
of 
the 
mind 
Because 
of 
this 
status 
as 
an 
explanandum 
experience 
cannot 
be 
discarded 
like 
the 
vital 
spirit 
when 
a 
new 
theory 
comes 
along 
Rather 
it 
is 
the 
central 
fact 
that 
any 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
must 
explain 
A 
theory 
that 
denies 
the 
phenomenon 
solves 
the 
problem 
by 
ducking 
the 
question
In 
a 
third 
option 
some 
researchers 
claim 
to 
be 
explaining 
experience 
in 
the 
full 
sense 
These 
researchers 
unlike 
those 
above 
wish 
to 
take 
experience 
very 
seriously 
they 
lay 
out 
their 
functional 
model 
or 
theory 
and 
claim 
that 
it 
explains 
the 
full 
subjective 
quality 
of 
experience 
e.g. 
Flohr 
1992 
Humphrey 
1992 
The 
relevant 
step 
in 
the 
explanation 
is 
usually 
passed 
over 
quickly 
however 
and 
usually 
ends 
up 
looking 
something 
like 
magic 
After 
some 
details 
about 
information 
processing 
are 
given 
experience 
suddenly 
enters 
the 
picture 
but 
it 
is 
left 
obscure 
how 
these 
processes 
should 
suddenly 
give 
rise 
to 
experience 
Perhaps 
it 
is
simply 
taken 
for 
granted 
that 
it 
does 
but 
then 
we 
have 
an 
incomplete 
explanation 
and 
a 
version 
of 
the 
fifth 
strategy 
below
A 
fourth 
more 
promising 
approach 
appeals 
to 
these 
methods 
to 
explain 
the 
structure 
of 
experience 
For 
example 
it 
is 
arguable 
that 
an 
account 
of 
the 
discriminations 
made 
by 
the 
visual 
system 
can 
account 
for 
the 
structural 
relations 
between 
different 
color 
experiences 
as 
well 
as 
for 
the 
geometric 
structure 
of 
the 
visual 
field 
see 
e.g. 
Clark 
1992 
Hardin 
1992 
In 
general 
certain 
facts 
about 
structures 
found 
in 
processing 
will 
correspond 
to 
and 
arguably 
explain 
facts 
about 
the 
structure 
of 
experience 
This 
strategy 
is 
plausible 
but 
limited 
At 
best 
it 
takes 
the 
existence 
of 
experience 
for 
granted 
and 
accounts 
for 
some 
facts 
about 
its structure 
providing 
a 
sort 
of 
nonreductive 
explanation 
of 
the 
structural 
aspects 
of 
experience 
I 
will 
say 
more 
on 
this 
later 
This 
is 
useful 
for 
many 
purposes 
but 
it 
tells 
us 
nothing 
about 
why 
there 
should 
be 
experience 
in 
the 
first 
place
A 
fifth 
and 
reasonable 
strategy 
is 
to 
isolate 
the 
substrate 
of 
experience 
After 
all 
almost 
everyone 
allows 
that 
experience 
arises 
one 
way 
or 
another 
from 
brain 
processes 
and 
it 
makes 
sense 
to 
identify 
the 
sort 
of 
process 
from 
which 
it 
arises 
Crick 
and 
Koch 
put 
their 
work 
forward 
as 
isolating 
the 
neural 
correlate 
of 
consciousness 
for 
example 
and 
Edelman 
1989 
and 
Jackendoff 
1988 
make 
related 
claims 
Justification 
of 
these 
claims 
requires 
a 
careful 
theoretical 
analysis 
especially 
as 
experience 
is 
not 
directly 
observable 
in 
experimental 
contexts 
but 
when 
applied 
judiciously 
this 
strategy 
can 
shed 
indirect 
light 
on 
the 
problem 
of 
experience 
Nevertheless 
the 
strategy 
is 
clearly 
incomplete 
For 
a 
satisfactory 
theory 
we 
need 
to 
know 
more 
than 
which 
processes 
give 
rise 
to 
experience 
we 
need 
an 
account 
of 
why 
and 
how 
A 
full 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
must 
build 
an 
explanatory 
bridge
The 
Extra 
Ingredient
We 
have 
seen 
that 
there 
are 
systematic 
reasons 
why 
the 
usual 
methods 
of 
cognitive 
science 
and 
neuroscience 
fail 
to 
account 
for 
conscious 
experience 
These 
are 
simply 
the 
wrong 
sort 
of 
methods 
nothing 
that 
they 
give 
to 
us 
can 
yield 
an 
explanation 
To 
account 
for 
conscious 
experience 
we 
need
an 
extra 
ingredient 
in 
the 
explanation 
This 
makes 
for 
a 
challenge 
to 
those 
who 
are 
serious 
about 
the 
hard 
problem 
of 
consciousness 
What 
is 
your 
extra 
ingredient 
and 
why 
should 
that 
account 
for 
conscious 
experience
There 
is 
no 
shortage 
of 
extra 
ingredients 
to 
be 
had 
Some 
propose 
an 
injection 
of 
chaos 
and 
nonlinear 
dynamics 
Some 
think 
that 
the 
key 
lies 
in 
nonalgorithmic 
processing 
Some 
appeal 
to 
future 
discoveries 
in 
neurophysiology 
Some 
suppose 
that 
the 
key 
to 
the 
mystery 
will 
lie 
at 
the 
level 
of 
quantum 
mechanics 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
see 
why 
all 
these 
suggestions 
are 
put
forward 
None 
of 
the 
old 
methods 
work 
so 
the 
solution 
must 
lie 
with 
something 
new
Unfortunately 
these 
suggestions 
all 
suffer 
from 
the 
same 
old 
problems
Nonalgorithmic 
processing 
for 
example 
is 
put 
forward 
by 
Penrose 
1989 
1994 
because 
of 
the 
role 
it 
might 
play 
in 
the 
process 
of 
conscious 
mathematical 
insight 
The 
arguments 
about 
mathematics 
are 
controversial 
but 
even 
if 
they 
succeed 
and 
an 
account 
of 
nonalgorithmic 
processing 
in 
the 
human 
brain 
is 
given 
it 
will 
still 
only 
be 
an 
account 
of 
the 
functions 
involved 
in 
mathematical 
reasoning 
and 
the 
like 
For 
a 
nonalgorithmic 
process 
as 
much 
as 
an 
algorithmic 
process 
the 
question 
is 
left 
unanswered 
why 
should 
this 
process 
give 
rise 
to 
experience 
In 
answering 
this 
question 
there 
is 
no 
special 
role 
for 
nonalgorithmic 
processing
The 
same 
goes 
for 
nonlinear 
and 
chaotic 
dynamics 
These 
might 
provide 
a 
novel 
account 
of 
the 
dynamics 
of 
cognitive 
functioning 
quite 
different 
from 
that 
given 
by 
standard 
methods 
in 
cognitive 
science 
But 
from 
dynamics 
one 
only 
gets 
more 
dynamics 
The 
question 
about 
experience 
here 
is 
as 
mysterious 
as 
ever 
The 
point 
is 
even 
clearer 
for 
new 
discoveries 
in 
neurophysiology 
These 
new 
discoveries 
may 
help 
us 
make 
significant 
progress 
in 
understanding 
brain 
function 
but 
for 
any 
neural 
process 
we 
isolate 
the 
same 
question 
will 
always 
arise 
It 
is 
difficult 
to 
imagine 
what 
a 
proponent 
of 
new 
neurophysiology 
expects 
to 
happen 
over 
and 
above 
the 
explanation 
of 
further 
cognitive 
functions 
It 
is 
not 
as 
if 
we 
will 
suddenly 
discover 
a 
phenomenal 
glow 
inside 
a 
neuron
Perhaps 
the 
most 
popular 
extra 
ingredient 
of 
all 
is 
quantum 
mechanics 
e.g.
Hameroff 
1994 
The 
attractiveness 
of 
quantum 
theories 
of 
consciousness 
may 
stem 
from 
a 
Law 
of 
Minimization 
of 
Mystery 
consciousness 
is 
mysterious 
and 
quantum 
mechanics 
is 
mysterious 
so 
maybe 
the 
two 
mysteries 
have 
a 
common 
source 
Nevertheless 
quantum 
theories 
of 
consciousness 
suffer 
from 
the 
same 
difficulties 
as 
neural 
or 
computational 
theories 
Quantum 
phenomena 
have 
some 
remarkable 
functional 
properties 
such 
as 
nondeterminism 
and 
nonlocality 
It 
is 
natural 
to 
speculate 
that 
these 
properties 
may 
play 
some 
role 
in 
the 
explanation 
of 
cognitive 
functions 
such 
as 
random 
choice 
and 
the 
integration 
of 
information 
and 
this 
hypothesis 
cannot 
be 
ruled 
out 
a 
priori 
But 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
the 
explanation 
of 
experience 
quantum 
processes 
are 
in 
the 
same 
boat 
as 
any 
other 
The 
question 
of 
why 
these 
processes 
should 
give 
rise 
to 
experience 
is 
entirely 
unanswered
One 
special 
attraction 
of 
quantum 
theories 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
on 
some 
interpretations 
of 
quantum 
mechanics 
consciousness 
plays 
an 
active 
role 
in 
collapsing 
the 
quantum 
wave 
function 
Such 
interpretations 
are 
controversial 
but 
in 
any 
case 
they 
offer 
no 
hope 
of 
explaining 
consciousness 
in 
terms 
of 
quantum 
processes 
Rather 
these 
theories 
assume 
the 
existence 
of 
consciousness 
and 
use 
it 
in 
the 
explanation 
of 
quantum 
processes 
At 
best 
these
theories 
tell 
us 
something 
about 
a 
physical 
role 
that 
consciousness 
may 
play 
They 
tell 
us 
nothing  
about 
how 
it 
arises
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
day 
the 
same 
criticism 
applies 
to 
any 
purely 
physical 
account 
of 
consciousness 
For 
any 
physical 
process 
we 
specify 
there 
will 
be 
an 
unanswered 
question 
Why 
should 
this 
process 
give 
rise 
to 
experience 
Given 
any 
such 
process 
it 
is 
conceptually 
coherent 
that 
it 
could 
be 
instantiated 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
experience 
It 
follows 
that 
no 
mere 
account 
of 
the 
physical 
process 
will 
tell 
us 
why 
experience 
arises 
The 
emergence 
of 
experience 
goes 
beyond 
what 
can 
be 
derived 
from 
physical 
theory
Purely 
physical 
explanation 
is 
well-suited 
to 
the 
explanation 
of 
physical 
structures 
explaining 
macroscopic 
structures 
in 
terms 
of 
detailed 
microstructural 
constituents 
and 
it 
provides 
a 
satisfying 
explanation 
of 
the 
performance 
of functions 
accounting 
for 
these 
functions 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
physical 
mechanisms 
that 
perform 
them 
This 
is 
because 
a 
physical 
account 
can 
entail 
the 
facts 
about 
structures 
and 
functions 
once 
the 
internal 
details 
of 
the 
physical 
account 
are 
given 
the 
structural 
and 
functional 
properties 
fall 
out 
as 
an 
automatic 
consequence 
But 
the 
structure 
and 
dynamics 
of 
physical 
processes 
yield 
only 
more 
structure 
and 
dynamics 
so 
structures 
and 
functions 
are 
all 
we 
can 
expect 
these 
processes 
to 
explain 
The 
facts 
about 
experience 
cannot 
be 
an 
automatic 
consequence 
of 
any 
physical 
account 
as 
it 
is 
conceptually 
coherent 
that 
any 
given 
process 
could 
exist 
without 
experience 
Experience 
may 
arise 
from 
the 
physical 
but 
it 
is 
not 
entailed 
by 
the 
physical
The 
moral 
of 
all 
this 
is 
that 
you 
cant 
explain 
conscious 
experience 
on 
the 
cheap 
It 
is 
a 
remarkable 
fact 
that 
reductive
methods
methods 
that 
explain 
a 
high-level 
phenomenon 
wholly 
in 
terms 
of 
more 
basic 
physical 
processes
work 
well 
in 
so 
many 
domains 
In 
a 
sense 
one 
can 
explain 
most 
biological 
and 
cognitive 
phenomena 
on 
the 
cheap 
in 
that 
these 
phenomena 
are 
seen 
as 
automatic 
consequences 
of 
more 
fundamental 
processes 
It 
would 
be 
wonderful 
if 
reductive 
methods 
could 
explain 
experience 
too 
I 
hoped 
for 
a 
long 
time 
that 
they 
might 
Unfortunately 
there 
are 
systematic 
reasons 
why 
these 
methods 
must 
fail 
Reductive 
methods 
are 
successful 
in
most 
domains 
because 
what 
needs 
explaining 
in 
those 
domains 
are 
structures 
and 
functions 
and 
these 
are 
the 
kind 
of 
thing 
that 
a 
physical 
account 
can 
entail 
When 
it 
comes 
to 
a 
problem 
over 
and 
above 
the 
explanation
of 
structures 
and 
functions 
these 
methods 
are 
impotent
This 
might 
seem 
reminiscent 
of 
the 
vitalist 
claim 
that 
no 
physical 
account 
could 
explain 
life 
but 
the 
cases 
are 
disanalogous 
What 
drove 
vitalist 
skepticism 
was 
doubt 
about 
whether 
physical 
mechanisms 
could 
perform 
the 
many 
remarkable 
functions 
associated 
with 
life 
such 
as 
complex 
adaptive 
behavior 
and 
reproduction 
The 
conceptual 
claim 
that 
explanation 
of 
functions 
is 
what 
is 
needed 
was 
implicitly 
accepted 
but 
lacking 
detailed 
knowledge 
of
biochemical 
mechanisms 
vitalists 
doubted 
whether 
any 
physical 
process 
could 
do 
the 
job 
and 
put 
forward 
the 
hypothesis 
of 
the 
vital 
spirit 
as 
an 
alternative 
explanation 
Once 
it 
turned 
out 
that 
physical 
processes 
could 
perform 
the 
relevant 
functions 
vitalist 
doubts 
melted 
away
With 
experience 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
physical 
explanation 
of 
the 
functions 
is 
not 
in 
question 
The 
key 
is 
instead 
the 
conceptual 
point 
that 
the 
explanation 
of 
functions 
does 
not 
suffice 
for 
the 
explanation 
of 
experience 
This 
basic 
conceptual 
point 
is 
not 
something 
that 
further 
neuroscientific 
investigation 
will 
affect 
In 
a 
similar 
way 
experience 
is 
disanalogous 
to 
the
elan 
vital 
The 
vital 
spirit 
was 
put 
forward 
as 
an 
explanatory 
posit 
in 
order 
to 
explain 
the 
relevant 
functions 
and 
could 
therefore 
be 
discarded 
when 
those 
functions 
were 
explained 
without 
it 
Experience 
is 
not 
an 
explanatory 
posit 
but 
an 
explanandum 
in 
its 
own 
right 
and 
so 
is 
not 
a 
candidate 
for 
this 
sort 
of 
elimination
It 
is 
tempting 
to 
note 
that 
all 
sorts 
of 
puzzling 
phenomena 
have 
eventually 
turned 
out 
to 
be 
explainable 
in 
physical 
terms 
But 
each 
of 
these 
were 
problems 
about 
the 
observable 
behavior 
of 
physical 
objects 
coming 
down 
to 
problems 
in 
the 
explanation 
of 
structures 
and 
functions 
Because 
of 
this 
these 
phenomena 
have 
always 
been 
the 
kind 
of 
thing 
that 
a 
physical 
account 
might 
explain 
even 
if 
at 
some 
points 
there 
have 
been 
good 
reasons 
to 
suspect 
that 
no 
such 
explanation 
would 
be 
forthcoming 
The 
tempting 
induction 
from 
these 
cases 
fails 
in 
the 
case 
of 
consciousness 
which 
is 
not 
a 
problem 
about 
physical 
structures 
and 
functions 
The 
problem 
of 
consciousness 
is 
puzzling 
in 
an 
entirely 
different 
way 
An 
analysis 
of 
the 
problem 
shows 
us 
that 
conscious 
experience 
is 
just 
not 
the 
kind 
of 
thing 
that 
a 
wholly 
reductive 
account 
could 
succeed 
in 
explaining
Nonreductive 
Explanation
At 
this 
point 
some 
are 
tempted 
to 
give 
up 
holding 
that 
we 
will 
never 
have 
a 
theory 
of 
conscious 
experience 
McGinn 
1989 
for 
example 
argues 
that 
the 
problem 
is 
too 
hard 
for 
our 
limited 
minds 
we 
are 
cognitively 
closed 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
phenomenon 
Others 
have 
argued 
that 
conscious 
experience 
lies 
outside 
the 
domain 
of 
scientific 
theory 
altogether
I 
think 
this 
pessimism 
is 
premature 
This 
is 
not 
the 
place 
to 
give 
up 
it 
is 
the 
place 
where 
things 
get 
interesting 
When 
simple 
methods 
of 
explanation 
are 
ruled 
out 
we 
need 
to 
investigate 
the 
alternatives 
Given 
that 
reductive 
explanation 
fails 
nonreductive 
explanation 
is 
the 
natural 
choice
Although 
a 
remarkable 
number 
of 
phenomena 
have 
turned 
out 
to 
be 
explicable 
wholly 
in 
terms 
of 
entities 
simpler 
than 
themselves 
this 
is 
not 
universal 
In 
physics 
it 
occasionally 
happens 
that 
an 
entity 
has 
to 
be 
taken 
as 
fundamental 
Fundamental 
entities 
are 
not 
explained
in 
terms 
of 
anything 
simpler 
Instead 
one 
takes 
them 
as 
basic 
and 
gives 
a 
theory 
of 
how 
they 
relate 
to 
everything 
else 
in 
the 
world 
For 
example 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
it 
turned 
out 
that 
electromagnetic 
processes 
could 
not 
be 
explained 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
wholly 
mechanical 
processes 
that 
previous 
physical 
theories 
appealed 
to 
so 
Maxwell 
and 
others 
introduced 
electromagnetic 
charge 
and 
electromagnetic 
forces 
as 
new 
fundamental 
components 
of 
a 
physical 
theory 
To 
explain 
electromagnetism 
the 
ontology 
of 
physics 
had 
to 
be 
expanded 
New 
basic 
properties 
and 
basic 
laws 
were 
needed 
to 
give 
a 
satisfactory 
account 
of 
the 
phenomena
Other 
features 
that 
physical 
theory 
takes 
as 
fundamental 
include 
mass 
and 
space-time 
No 
attempt 
is 
made 
to 
explain 
these 
features 
in 
terms 
of 
anything 
simpler 
But 
this 
does 
not 
rule 
out 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
theory 
of 
mass 
or 
of 
space-time 
There 
is 
an 
intricate 
theory 
of 
how 
these 
features 
interrelate 
and 
of 
the 
basic 
laws 
they 
enter 
into 
These 
basic 
principles 
are 
used 
to 
explain 
many 
familiar 
phenomena 
concerning 
mass 
space 
and 
time 
at 
a 
higher 
level
I 
suggest 
that 
a 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
should 
take 
experience 
as 
fundamental 
We 
know 
that 
a 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
requires 
the 
addition 
of 
something 
fundamental 
to 
our 
ontology 
as 
everything 
in 
physical 
theory 
is 
compatible 
with 
the 
absence 
of 
consciousness 
We 
might 
add 
some 
entirely 
new 
nonphysical 
feature 
from 
which 
experience 
can 
be 
derived 
but 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
see 
what 
such 
a 
feature 
would 
be 
like 
More 
likely 
we 
will 
take 
experience 
itself 
as 
a 
fundamental 
feature 
of 
the 
world 
alongside 
mass 
charge 
and 
space-time 
If 
we 
take 
experience 
as 
fundamental 
then 
we 
can 
go 
about 
the 
business 
of 
constructing 
a 
theory 
of 
experience
Where 
there 
is 
a 
fundamental 
property 
there 
are 
fundamental 
laws
A 
nonreductive 
theory 
of 
experience 
will 
add 
new 
principles 
to 
the 
furniture 
of 
the 
basic 
laws 
of 
nature 
These 
basic 
principles 
will 
ultimately 
carry 
the 
explanatory 
burden 
in 
a 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
Just 
as 
we 
explain 
familiar 
high-level 
phenomena 
involving 
mass 
in 
terms 
of 
more 
basic 
principles 
involving 
mass 
and 
other 
entities
we 
might 
explain 
familiar 
phenomena 
involving 
experience 
in 
terms 
of 
more 
basic 
principles 
involving 
experience 
and 
other 
entities
In 
particular 
a 
nonreductive 
theory 
of 
experience 
will 
specify 
basic 
principles 
telling 
us 
how 
experience 
depends 
on 
physical 
features 
of 
the 
world 
These 
psychophysical 
principles 
will 
not 
interfere 
with 
physical 
laws 
as 
it 
seems 
that 
physical 
laws 
already 
form 
a 
closed 
system 
Rather 
they 
will 
be 
a 
supplement 
to 
a 
physical 
theory 
A 
physical 
theory 
gives 
a 
theory 
of 
physical 
processes 
and 
a 
psychophysical 
theory 
tells 
us 
how 
those 
processes 
give 
rise 
to 
experience 
We 
know 
that 
experience 
depends 
on 
physical 
processes
but 
we 
also 
know 
that 
this 
dependence 
cannot 
be 
derived 
from 
physical 
laws 
alone
The 
new 
basic 
principles 
postulated 
by 
a 
nonreductive 
theory 
give 
us 
the 
extra 
ingredient 
that 
we 
need 
to 
build 
an 
explanatory 
bridge
Of 
course 
by 
taking 
experience 
as
fundamental 
there 
is 
a 
sense 
in 
which 
this 
approach 
does 
not 
tell 
us 
why 
there 
is 
experience 
in 
the 
first 
place 
But 
this 
is 
the 
same 
for 
any 
fundamental 
theory 
Nothing 
in 
physics 
tells 
us 
why 
there 
is 
matter 
in 
the 
first 
place 
but 
we 
do 
not 
count 
this 
against 
theories 
of 
matter 
Certain 
features 
of 
the 
world 
need 
to 
be 
taken 
as 
fundamental 
by 
any 
scientific 
theory 
A 
theory 
of 
matter 
can 
still 
explain 
all 
sorts 
of 
facts 
about 
matter 
by 
showing 
how 
they 
are 
consequences 
of 
the 
basic 
laws 
The 
same 
goes 
for 
a 
theory 
of 
experience
This 
position 
qualifies 
as 
a 
variety 
of 
dualism 
as 
it 
postulates 
basic 
properties 
over 
and 
above 
the 
properties 
invoked 
by 
physics 
But 
it 
is 
an 
innocent 
version 
of 
dualism 
entirely 
compatible 
with 
the 
scientific 
view 
of 
the 
world 
Nothing 
in 
this 
approach 
contradicts 
anything 
in 
physical 
theory 
we 
simply 
need 
to 
add 
further 
bridging 
principles 
to 
explain 
how 
experience 
arises 
from 
physical 
processes 
There 
is 
nothing 
particularly 
spiritual 
or 
mystical 
about 
this 
theory
its 
overall 
shape 
is 
like 
that 
of 
a 
physical 
theory 
with 
a 
few 
fundamental 
entities 
connected 
by 
fundamental 
laws 
It 
expands 
the 
ontology 
slightly 
to 
be 
sure 
but 
Maxwell 
did 
the 
same 
thing
Indeed 
the 
overall 
structure 
of 
this 
position 
is 
entirely 
naturalistic 
allowing 
that 
ultimately 
the 
universe 
comes 
down 
to 
a 
network 
of 
basic 
entities 
obeying 
simple 
laws 
and 
allowing 
that 
there 
may 
ultimately 
be 
a 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
cast 
in 
terms 
of 
such 
laws 
If 
the 
position 
is 
to 
have 
a 
name 
a 
good 
choice 
might 
be 
naturalistic 
dualism
If 
this 
view 
is 
right 
then 
in 
some 
ways 
a 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
will 
have 
more 
in 
common 
with 
a 
theory 
in 
physics 
than 
a 
theory 
in 
biology 
Biological 
theories 
involve 
no 
principles 
that 
are 
fundamental 
in 
this 
way 
so 
biological 
theory 
has 
a 
certain 
complexity 
and 
messiness 
to 
it 
but 
theories 
in 
physics 
insofar 
as 
they 
deal 
with 
fundamental 
principles 
aspire 
to 
simplicity 
and 
elegance 
The 
fundamental 
laws 
of 
nature 
are 
part 
of 
the 
basic 
furniture 
of 
the 
world 
and 
physical 
theories 
are 
telling 
us 
that 
this 
basic 
furniture 
is 
remarkably 
simple 
If 
a 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
also 
involves 
fundamental 
principles 
then 
we 
should 
expect 
the 
same 
The 
principles 
of 
simplicity 
elegance
and 
even 
beauty 
that 
drive 
physicists 
search 
for 
a 
fundamental 
theory 
will 
also 
apply 
to 
a 
theory 
of 
consciousness
A 
technical 
note 
Some 
philosophers 
argue 
that 
even 
though 
there 
is 
a 
conceptual 
gap 
between 
physical 
processes 
and 
experience 
there 
need 
be 
no 
metaphysical 
gap 
so 
that 
experience 
might 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
still 
be 
physical 
e.g. 
Hill 
1991 
Levine 
1983 
Loar 
1990 
Usually 
this 
line 
of 
argument 
is 
supported 
by 
an 
appeal 
to 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
posteriori 
necessity 
Kripke 
1980 
I 
think 
that 
this 
position 
rests 
on 
a 
misunderstanding 
of 
a 
posteriori 
necessity 
however 
or 
else 
requires 
an 
entirely 
new 
sort 
of 
necessity 
that 
we 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
believe 
in 
see 
Chalmers 
1996 
also 
Jackson 
1994 
and 
Lewis 
1994 
for 
details 
In 
any 
case 
this
position 
still 
concedes 
an 
explanatory 
gap 
between 
physical 
processes 
and 
experience 
For 
example 
the 
principles 
connecting 
the 
physical 
and 
the 
experiential 
will 
not 
be 
derivable 
from 
the 
laws 
of 
physics 
so 
such 
principles 
must 
be 
taken 
as 
explanatorily 
fundamental 
So 
even 
on 
this 
sort 
of 
view 
the 
explanatory 
structure 
of 
a 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
will 
be 
much 
as 
I 
have 
described
Outline 
of 
a 
Theory 
of 
Consciousness
It 
is 
not 
too 
soon 
to 
begin 
work 
on 
a 
theory 
We 
are 
already 
in 
a 
position 
to 
understand 
certain 
key 
facts 
about 
the 
relationship 
between 
physical 
processes 
and 
experience 
and 
about 
the 
regularities 
that 
connect 
them 
Once 
reductive 
explanation 
is 
set 
aside 
we 
can 
lay 
those 
facts 
on 
the 
table 
so 
that 
they 
can 
play 
their 
proper 
role 
as 
the 
initial 
pieces 
in 
a 
nonreductive 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
and 
as 
constraints 
on 
the 
basic 
laws 
that 
constitute 
an 
ultimate 
theory
There 
is 
an 
obvious 
problem 
that 
plagues 
the 
development 
of 
a 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
and 
that 
is 
the 
paucity 
of 
objective 
data 
Conscious 
experience 
is 
not 
directly 
observable 
in 
an 
experimental 
context 
so 
we 
cannot 
generate 
data 
about 
the 
relationship 
between 
physical 
processes 
and 
experience 
at 
will 
Nevertheless 
we 
all 
have 
access 
to 
a 
rich 
source 
of 
data 
in 
our 
own 
case 
Many 
important 
regularities 
between 
experience 
and 
processing 
can 
be 
inferred 
from 
considerations 
about 
ones 
own 
experience 
There 
are 
also 
good 
indirect 
sources 
of 
data 
from 
observable 
cases 
as 
when 
one 
relies 
on 
the 
verbal 
report 
of 
a 
subject 
as 
an 
indication 
of 
experience 
These 
methods 
have 
their 
limitations 
but 
we 
have 
more 
than 
enough 
data 
to 
get 
a 
theory 
off 
the 
ground
Philosophical 
analysis 
is 
also 
useful 
in 
getting 
value 
for 
money 
out 
of 
the 
data 
we 
have 
This 
sort 
of 
analysis 
can 
yield 
a 
number 
of 
principles 
relating 
consciousness 
and 
cognition 
thereby 
strongly 
constraining 
the 
shape 
of 
an 
ultimate 
theory 
The 
method 
of 
thought 
experimentation 
can 
also 
yield 
significant 
rewards 
as 
we 
will 
see 
Finally 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
are 
searching 
for 
a 
fundamental 
theory 
means 
that 
we 
can 
appeal 
to 
such 
nonempirical 
constraints 
as 
simplicity 
homogeneity 
and 
the 
like 
in 
developing 
a 
theory 
We 
must 
seek 
to 
systematize 
the 
information 
we 
have 
to 
extend 
it 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
by 
careful 
analysis 
and 
then 
make 
the 
inference 
to 
the 
simplest 
possible 
theory 
that 
explains 
the 
data 
while 
remaining 
a 
plausible 
candidate 
to 
be 
part 
of 
the 
fundamental 
furniture
of 
the 
world
Such 
theories 
will 
always 
retain 
an 
element 
of 
speculation 
that 
is 
not 
present 
in 
other 
scientific 
theories 
because 
of 
the 
impossibility 
of 
conclusive 
intersubjective 
experimental 
tests 
Still 
we 
can 
certainly 
construct 
theories 
that 
are 
compatible 
with 
the 
data 
that 
we 
have
and 
evaluate 
them 
in 
comparison 
to 
each 
other 
Even 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
intersubjective 
observation
there 
are 
numerous 
criteria 
available 
for 
the 
evaluation 
of 
such 
theories 
simplicity 
internal 
coherence 
coherence 
with 
theories 
in 
other 
domains 
the 
ability 
to 
reproduce 
the 
properties 
of 
experience 
that 
are 
familiar 
from 
our 
own 
case 
and 
even 
an 
overall 
fit 
with 
the 
dictates 
of 
common 
sense 
Perhaps 
there 
will 
be 
significant 
indeterminacies 
remaining 
even 
when 
all 
these 
constraints 
are 
applied 
but 
we 
can 
at 
least 
develop 
plausible 
candidates 
Only 
when 
candidate 
theories 
have 
been 
developed 
will 
we 
be 
able 
to 
evaluate 
them
A 
nonreductive 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
will 
consist 
in 
a 
number 
of 
psychophysical 
principles 
principles 
connecting 
the 
properties 
of 
physical 
processes 
to 
the 
properties 
of 
experience 
We 
can 
think 
of 
these 
principles 
as 
encapsulating 
the 
way 
in 
which 
experience 
arises 
from 
the 
physical 
Ultimately 
these 
principles 
should 
tell 
us 
what 
sort 
of 
physical 
systems 
will 
have 
associated 
experiences 
and 
for 
the 
systems 
that 
do 
they 
should 
tell 
us 
what 
sort 
of 
physical 
properties 
are 
relevant 
to 
the 
emergence 
of 
experience 
and 
just 
what 
sort 
of 
experience 
we 
should 
expect 
any 
given 
physical 
system 
to 
yield 
This 
is 
a 
tall 
order 
but 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
why 
we 
should 
not 
get 
started
In 
what 
follows 
I 
present 
my 
own 
candidates 
for 
the 
psychophysical 
principles 
that 
might 
go 
into 
a 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
The 
first 
two 
of 
these 
are 
nonbasic 
principles 
systematic 
connections 
between 
processing 
and 
experience 
at 
a 
relatively 
high 
level 
These 
principles 
can 
play 
a 
significant 
role 
in 
developing 
and 
constraining 
a 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
but 
they 
are 
not 
cast 
at 
a 
sufficiently 
fundamental 
level 
to 
qualify 
as 
truly 
basic 
laws 
The 
final 
principle 
is 
my 
candidate 
for 
a 
basic 
principle 
that 
might 
form 
the 
cornerstone
of 
a 
fundamental 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
This 
final 
principle 
is 
particularly 
speculative 
but 
it 
is 
the 
kind 
of 
speculation 
that 
is 
required 
if 
we 
are 
ever 
to 
have 
a 
satisfying 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
I 
can 
present 
these 
principles 
only 
briefly 
here 
I 
argue 
for 
them 
at 
much 
greater 
length 
in 
Chalmers 
1996 
The 
principle 
of 
structural 
coherence
This 
is 
a 
principle 
of 
coherence 
between 
the 
structure 
of 
consciousness 
and 
the 
structure
of 
awareness 
Recall 
that 
awareness 
was 
used 
earlier 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
various 
functional 
phenomena 
that 
are 
associated 
with 
consciousness 
I 
am 
now 
using 
it 
to 
refer 
to 
a 
somewhat 
more 
specific 
process 
in 
the 
cognitive 
underpinnings 
of 
experience 
In 
particular 
the 
contents 
of 
awareness 
are 
to 
be 
understood 
as 
those 
information 
contents 
that 
are 
accessible 
to 
central 
systems 
and 
brought 
to 
bear 
in 
a 
widespread 
way 
in 
the 
control 
of 
behavior 
Briefly 
put
we 
can 
think 
of 
awareness 
as 
direct 
availability 
for 
global 
control 
To 
a 
first 
approximation 
the
contents 
of 
awareness 
are 
the 
contents 
that 
are 
directly 
accessible 
and 
potentially 
reportable 
at 
least 
in 
a 
language-using 
system
Awareness 
is 
a 
purely 
functional 
notion 
but 
it 
is 
nevertheless 
intimately 
linked 
to 
conscious 
experience 
In 
familiar 
cases 
wherever 
we 
find 
consciousness 
we 
find 
awareness 
Wherever 
there 
is 
conscious 
experience 
there 
is 
some 
corresponding 
information 
in 
the 
cognitive 
system 
that 
is 
available 
in 
the 
control 
of 
behavior 
and 
available 
for 
verbal 
report 
Conversely 
it 
seems 
that 
whenever 
information 
is 
available 
for 
report 
and 
for 
global 
control 
there 
is 
a 
corresponding 
conscious 
experience 
Thus 
there 
is 
a 
direct 
correspondence 
between 
consciousness 
and 
awareness
The 
correspondence 
can 
be 
taken 
further 
It 
is 
a 
central 
fact 
about 
experience 
that 
it 
has 
a 
complex 
structure 
The 
visual 
field 
has 
a 
complex 
geometry 
for 
instance 
There 
are 
also 
relations 
of 
similarity 
and 
difference 
between 
experiences 
and 
relations 
in 
such 
things 
as 
relative 
intensity 
Every 
subjects 
experience 
can 
be 
at 
least 
partly 
characterized 
and 
decomposed 
in 
terms 
of 
these 
structural 
properties 
similarity 
and 
difference 
relations 
perceived 
location 
relative 
intensity 
geometric 
structure 
and 
so 
on 
It 
is 
also 
a 
central 
fact 
that 
to 
each 
of 
these 
structural 
features 
there 
is 
a 
corresponding 
feature 
in 
the 
information 
processing 
structure 
of 
awareness
Take 
color 
sensations 
as 
an 
example 
For 
every 
distinction 
between 
color 
experiences 
there 
is 
a 
corresponding 
distinction 
in 
processing 
The 
different 
phenomenal 
colors 
that 
we 
experience 
form 
a 
complex 
three
dimensional 
space 
varying 
in 
hue 
saturation 
and 
intensity 
The 
properties 
of 
this 
space 
can 
be 
recovered 
from 
information-processing 
considerations 
examination 
of 
the 
visual 
systems 
shows 
that 
waveforms 
of 
light 
are 
discriminated 
and 
analyzed 
along 
three 
different 
axes 
and 
it 
is 
this 
three-dimensional 
information 
that 
is 
relevant 
to 
later 
processing 
The 
three-dimensional 
structure 
of 
phenomenal 
color 
space 
therefore 
corresponds 
directly 
to 
the 
three 
dimensional 
structure 
of 
visual 
awareness
This 
is 
precisely 
what 
we 
would 
expect 
After 
all 
every 
color 
distinction 
corresponds 
to 
some 
reportable 
information 
and 
therefore 
to 
a 
distinction 
that 
is 
represented 
in 
the 
structure 
of 
processing
In 
a 
more 
straightforward 
way 
the 
geometric 
structure 
of 
the 
visual 
field 
is 
directly 
reflected 
in 
a 
structure 
that 
can 
be 
recovered 
from 
visual 
processing 
Every 
geometric 
relation 
corresponds 
to 
something 
that 
can 
be 
reported 
and 
is 
therefore 
cognitively 
represented 
If 
we 
were 
given 
only 
the 
story 
about 
information-processing 
in 
an 
agents 
visual 
and 
cognitive 
system
we 
could 
not 
directly 
observe 
that 
agents 
visual 
experiences 
but 
we 
could 
nevertheless 
infer 
those 
experiences 
structural properties
In 
general 
any 
information 
that 
is 
consciously 
experienced 
will 
also 
be 
cognitively 
represented 
The 
fine-grained 
structure 
of 
the 
visual 
field 
will 
correspond 
to 
some 
fine-grained 
structure 
in 
visual 
processing 
The 
same 
goes 
for 
experiences 
in 
other 
modalities 
and 
even 
for 
nonsensory 
experiences 
Internal 
mental 
images 
have 
geometric 
properties 
that 
are 
represented 
in 
processing 
Even 
emotions 
have 
structural 
properties 
such 
as 
relative 
intensity 
that 
correspond 
directly 
to 
a 
structural 
property 
of 
processing 
where 
there 
is 
greater 
intensity 
we 
find 
a 
greater 
effect 
on 
later 
processes 
In 
general 
precisely 
because 
the 
structural 
properties 
of 
experience 
are 
accessible 
and 
reportable 
those 
properties 
will 
be 
directly 
represented 
in 
the 
structure 
of 
awareness
It 
is 
this 
isomorphism 
between 
the 
structures 
of 
consciousness 
and 
awareness 
that 
constitutes 
the 
principle 
of 
structural 
coherence 
This 
principle 
reflects 
the 
central 
fact 
that 
even 
though 
cognitive 
processes 
do 
not 
conceptually 
entail 
facts 
about 
conscious 
experience 
consciousness 
and 
cognition 
do 
not 
float 
free 
of 
one 
another 
but 
cohere 
in 
an 
intimate 
way
This 
principle 
has 
its 
limits 
It 
allows 
us 
to 
recover 
structural 
properties 
of 
experience 
from 
information-processing 
properties 
but 
not 
all 
properties 
of 
experience 
are 
structural 
properties 
There 
are 
properties 
of 
experience 
such 
as 
the 
intrinsic 
nature 
of 
a 
sensation 
of 
red 
that 
cannot 
be 
fully 
captured 
in 
a 
structural 
description 
The 
very 
intelligibility 
of 
inverted 
spectrum 
scenarios 
where 
experiences 
of 
red 
and 
green 
are 
inverted 
but 
all 
structural 
properties 
remain 
the 
same 
show 
that 
structural 
properties 
constrain 
experience 
without 
exhausting 
it 
Nevertheless 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
we 
feel 
compelled 
to 
leave 
structural 
properties 
unaltered 
when 
we 
imagine 
experiences 
inverted 
between 
functionally 
identical 
systems 
shows 
how 
central 
the 
principle 
of 
structural 
coherence 
is 
to 
our 
conception 
of 
our 
mental 
lives 
It 
is 
not 
a 
logically 
necessary 
principle 
as 
after 
all 
we 
can 
imagine 
all 
the 
information 
processing 
occurring 
without 
any 
experience 
at 
all 
but 
it 
is 
nevertheless 
a 
strong 
and 
familiar 
constraint 
on 
the
psychophysical 
connection
The 
principle 
of 
structural 
coherence 
allows 
for 
a 
very 
useful 
kind 
of 
indirect 
explanation 
of 
experience 
in 
terms 
of 
physical 
processes
For 
example 
we 
can 
use 
facts 
about 
neural 
processing 
of 
visual 
information 
to 
indirectly 
explain 
the 
structure 
of 
color 
space 
The 
facts 
about 
neural 
processing 
can 
entail 
and 
explain 
the 
structure 
of 
awareness 
if 
we 
take 
the 
coherence 
principle 
for 
granted 
the 
structure 
of 
experience 
will 
also 
be 
explained 
Empirical 
investigation 
might 
even 
lead 
us 
to 
better 
understand 
the 
structure 
of 
awareness 
within 
a 
bat 
shedding 
indirect 
light 
on 
Nagels 
vexing 
question 
of 
what 
it 
is 
like 
to 
be 
a 
bat 
This 
principle 
provides 
a 
natural 
interpretation 
of 
much 
existing 
work 
on 
the 
explanation 
of 
consciousness 
e.g. 
Clark 
1992 
and 
Hardin 
1992 
on 
colors
and 
Akins 
1993 
on 
bats 
although 
it 
is 
often
appealed 
to 
inexplicitly 
It 
is 
so 
familiar 
that 
it 
is 
taken 
for 
granted 
by 
almost 
everybody 
and 
is 
a 
central 
plank 
in 
the 
cognitive 
explanation 
of 
consciousness
The 
coherence 
between 
consciousness 
and 
awareness 
also 
allows 
a 
natural 
interpretation 
of 
work 
in 
neuroscience 
directed 
at 
isolating 
the 
substrate 
or 
the 
neural 
correlate 
of 
consciousness 
Various 
specific 
hypotheses 
have 
been 
put 
forward 
For 
example 
Crick 
and 
Koch 
1990 
suggest 
that 
40-Hz 
oscillations 
may 
be 
the 
neural 
correlate 
of 
consciousness 
whereas 
Libet 
1993 
suggests 
that 
temporally
extended 
neural 
activity 
is 
central 
If 
we 
accept 
the 
principle 
of 
coherence 
the 
most 
direct 
physical 
correlate 
of 
consciousness 
is 
awareness 
the 
process 
whereby 
information 
is 
made 
directly 
available 
for 
global 
control 
The 
different 
specific 
hypotheses 
can 
be 
interpreted 
as 
empirical 
suggestions 
about 
how 
awareness 
might 
be 
achieved 
For 
example 
Crick 
and 
Koch 
suggest 
that 
40-Hz 
oscillations 
are 
the 
gateway 
by 
which 
information 
is 
integrated 
into 
working 
memory 
and 
thereby 
made 
available 
to 
later 
processes 
Similarly 
it 
is 
natural 
to 
suppose 
that 
Libets 
temporally 
extended 
activity 
is 
relevant 
precisely 
because 
only 
that 
sort 
of 
activity 
achieves 
global 
availability 
The 
same 
applies 
to 
other 
suggested 
correlates 
such 
as 
the 
global 
workspace 
of 
Baars 
1988 
the 
high-quality 
representations 
of 
Farah 
1994 
and 
the 
selector 
inputs 
to 
action 
systems
of 
Shallice 
1972 
All 
these 
can 
be 
seen 
as 
hypotheses 
about 
the 
mechanisms 
of 
awareness 
the 
mechanisms 
that 
perform 
the 
function 
of 
making 
information 
directly 
available 
for 
global 
control
Given 
the 
coherence 
between 
consciousness 
and 
awareness 
it 
follows 
that 
a 
mechanism 
of 
awareness 
will 
itself 
be 
a 
correlate 
of 
conscious 
experience 
The 
question 
of 
just 
which 
mechanisms 
in 
the 
brain 
govern 
global 
availability 
is 
an 
empirical 
one 
perhaps 
there 
are 
many 
such 
mechanisms 
But 
if 
we 
accept 
the 
coherence 
principle 
we 
have 
reason 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
processes 
that 
explain 
awareness 
will 
at 
the 
same 
time 
be 
part 
of 
the 
basis 
of 
consciousness
2 
The 
principle 
of 
organizational 
invariance
This 
principle 
states 
that 
any 
two 
systems 
with 
the 
same 
fine-grained 
functional
organization 
will 
have 
qualitatively 
identical 
experiences 
If 
the 
causal 
patterns 
of 
neural 
organization 
were 
duplicated 
in 
silicon
for 
example 
with 
a 
silicon 
chip 
for 
every 
neuron 
and 
the 
same 
patterns 
of 
interaction 
then 
the 
same 
experiences 
would 
arise 
According 
to 
this 
principle 
what 
matters 
for 
the 
emergence 
of 
experience 
is 
not 
the 
specific 
physical 
makeup 
of 
a 
system
but 
the 
abstract 
pattern 
of 
causal 
interaction 
between 
its 
components 
This 
principle 
is 
controversial 
of 
course 
Some 
e.g. 
Searle 
1980 
have 
thought 
that 
consciousness 
is 
tied 
to 
a 
specific 
biology 
so 
that 
a 
silicon 
isomorph 
of 
a 
human 
need 
not 
be 
conscious 
I 
believe 
that
the 
principle 
can 
be 
given 
significant 
support 
by 
the 
analysis 
of 
thought-experiments 
however
Very 
briefly 
suppose 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
a 
reductio 
ad 
absurdum 
that 
the 
principle 
is 
false 
and 
that 
there 
could 
be 
two 
functionally 
isomorphic 
systems 
with 
different 
experiences 
Perhaps 
only 
one 
of 
the 
systems 
is 
conscious 
or 
perhaps 
both 
are 
conscious 
but 
they 
have 
different 
experiences 
For 
the 
purposes 
of 
illustration 
let 
us 
say 
that 
one 
system 
is 
made 
of 
neurons 
and 
the 
other 
of 
silicon 
and 
that 
one 
experiences 
red 
where 
the 
other 
experiences 
blue 
The 
two 
systems 
have 
the 
same 
organization 
so 
we 
can 
imagine 
gradually 
transforming 
one 
into 
the 
other 
perhaps 
replacing 
neurons 
one 
at 
a 
time 
by 
silicon 
chips 
with 
the 
same 
local 
function 
We 
thus 
gain 
a 
spectrum 
of 
intermediate 
cases
each 
with 
the 
same 
organization 
but 
with 
slightly 
different 
physical 
makeup 
and 
slightly 
different 
experiences 
Along 
this 
spectrum 
there 
must 
be 
two 
systems 
A 
and 
B 
between 
which 
we 
replace 
less 
than 
one 
tenth 
of 
the 
system 
but 
whose 
experiences 
differ 
These 
two 
systems 
are 
physically 
identical 
except 
that 
a 
small 
neural 
circuit 
in 
A 
has 
been 
replaced 
by 
a 
silicon 
circuit 
in 
B
The 
key 
step 
in 
the 
thought
experiment 
is 
to 
take 
the 
relevant 
neural 
circuit 
in 
A 
and 
install 
alongside 
it 
a 
causally 
isomorphic 
silicon 
circuit
with 
a 
switch 
between 
the 
two 
What 
happens 
when 
we 
flip 
the 
switch 
By 
hypothesis 
the 
systems 
conscious 
experiences 
will 
change 
from 
red 
to 
blue 
say 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
illustration 
This 
follows 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
system 
after 
the 
change 
is 
essentially 
a 
version 
of 
B 
whereas 
before 
the 
change 
it 
is 
just 
A
But 
given 
the 
assumptions 
there 
is 
no 
way 
for 
the 
system 
to 
notice 
the 
changes 
Its 
causal 
organization 
stays 
constant 
so 
that 
all 
of 
its 
functional 
states 
and 
behavioral 
dispositions 
stay 
fixed 
As 
far 
as 
the 
system 
is 
concerned 
nothing 
unusual 
has 
happened 
There 
is 
no 
room 
for 
the 
thought 
Hmm 
Something 
strange 
just 
happened 
In 
general 
the 
structure 
of 
any 
such 
thought 
must 
be 
reflected 
in 
processing 
but 
the 
structure 
of 
processing 
remains 
constant 
here 
If 
there 
were 
to 
be 
such 
a 
thought 
it 
must 
float 
entirely 
free 
of 
the 
system 
and 
would 
be 
utterly 
impotent 
to 
affect 
later 
processing 
If 
it 
affected 
later 
processing 
the 
systems 
would 
be 
functionally 
distinct 
contrary 
to 
hypothesis 
We 
might 
even 
flip 
the 
switch 
a 
number 
of 
times 
so 
that 
experiences 
of 
red 
and 
blue 
dance 
back 
and 
forth 
before 
the 
systems 
inner 
eye 
According 
to 
hypothesis 
the 
system 
can 
never 
notice 
these 
dancing 
qualia
This 
I 
take 
to 
be 
a 
reductio 
of 
the 
original 
assumption 
It 
is 
a 
central 
fact 
about 
experience 
very 
familiar 
from 
our 
own 
case 
that 
whenever 
experiences 
change 
significantly 
and 
we 
are 
paying 
attention 
we 
can 
notice 
the 
change 
if 
this 
were 
not 
to 
be 
the 
case 
we 
would 
be 
led 
to 
the 
skeptical 
possibility 
that 
our 
experiences 
are 
dancing 
before 
our 
eyes 
all
the 
time 
This 
hypothesis 
has 
the 
same 
status 
as 
the 
possibility 
that 
the 
world 
was 
created 
five 
minutes 
ago 
perhaps 
it 
is 
logically 
coherent 
but 
it 
is 
not 
plausible 
Given 
the 
extremely 
plausible 
assumption 
that 
changes 
in 
experience 
correspond 
to 
changes 
in 
processing 
we 
are 
led 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
original 
hypothesis 
is 
impossible 
and 
that 
any 
two 
functionally 
isomorphic 
systems 
must 
have 
the 
same 
sort 
of 
experiences 
To 
put 
it 
in 
technical 
terms 
the 
philosophical 
hypotheses 
of 
absent 
qualia 
and 
inverted 
qualia 
while 
logically 
possible 
are 
empirically 
and 
nomologically 
impossible
Some 
may 
worry 
that 
a 
silicon 
isomorph 
of 
a 
neural 
system 
might 
be 
impossible 
for 
technical 
reasons 
That 
question 
is 
open 
The 
invariance 
principle 
says 
only 
that 
if 
an 
isomorph 
is 
possible 
then 
it 
will 
have 
the 
same 
sort 
of 
conscious 
experience
There 
is 
more 
to 
be 
said 
here 
but 
this 
gives 
the 
basic 
flavor 
Once 
again 
this 
thought 
experiment 
draws 
on 
familiar 
facts 
about 
the 
coherence
between 
consciousness 
and 
cognitive 
processing 
to 
yield 
a 
strong 
conclusion 
about 
the 
relation 
between 
physical 
structure 
and 
experience 
If 
the 
argument 
goes 
through 
we 
know 
that 
the 
only 
physical 
properties 
directly 
relevant 
to 
the 
emergence 
of 
experience 
are 
organizational 
properties 
This 
acts 
as 
a 
further 
strong 
constraint 
on 
a 
theory 
of 
consciousness
3 
The 
double
aspect 
theory 
of 
information
The 
two 
preceding 
principles 
have 
been 
nonbasic 
principles 
They 
involve 
high
level
notions 
such 
as 
awareness 
and 
organization 
and 
therefore 
lie 
at 
the 
wrong 
level 
to 
constitute 
the 
fundamental 
laws 
in 
a 
theory 
of 
consciousness 
Nevertheless 
they 
act 
as 
strong 
constraints 
What 
is 
further 
needed 
are 
basic 
principles 
that 
fit
these 
constraints 
and 
that 
might 
ultimately 
explain 
them
The 
basic 
principle 
that 
I 
suggest 
centrally 
involves 
the 
notion 
of 
information 
I 
understand 
information 
in 
more 
or 
less 
the 
sense 
of 
Shannon 
1948 
Where 
there 
is 
information 
there 
are 
information 
states 
embedded 
in 
an 
information 
space
An 
information 
space 
has 
a 
basic 
structure 
of 
difference 
relations 
between 
its 
elements 
characterizing 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
different 
elements 
in 
a 
space 
are 
similar 
or 
different 
possibly 
in 
complex 
ways
An 
information 
space 
is 
an 
abstract 
object 
but 
following 
Shannon 
we 
can 
see 
information 
as 
physically 
embodied 
when 
there 
is 
a 
space 
of 
distinct 
physical 
states 
the 
differences 
between 
which 
can 
be 
transmitted 
down 
some 
causal 
pathway 
The 
states 
that 
are 
transmitted 
can 
be 
seen 
as 
themselves 
constituting 
an 
information 
space 
To 
borrow 
a 
phrase 
from 
Bateson 
1972 
physical 
information 
is 
a 
difference 
that 
makes 
a 
difference
The 
double
aspect 
principle 
stems 
from 
the 
observation 
that 
there 
is 
a 
direct 
isomorphism 
between 
certain 
physically 
embodied 
information 
spaces 
and 
certain
phenomenal 
or 
experiential 
information 
spaces 
From 
the 
same 
sort 
of 
observations 
that 
went 
into 
the 
principle 
of 
structural 
coherence 
we 
can 
note 
that 
the 
differences 
between 
phenomenal 
states 
have 
a 
structure 
that 
corresponds 
directly 
to 
the 
differences 
embedded 
in 
physical 
processes 
in 
particular 
to 
those 
differences 
that 
make 
a 
difference 
down 
certain 
causal 
pathways 
implicated 
in 
global 
availability 
and 
control 
That 
is 
we 
can 
find 
the 
same 
abstract 
information 
space 
embedded 
in 
physical 
processing 
and 
in 
conscious 
experience
This 
leads 
to 
a 
natural 
hypothesis 
that 
information 
or 
at 
least 
some 
information 
has 
two 
basic 
aspects 
a 
physical 
aspect 
and 
a 
phenomenal 
aspect 
This 
has 
the 
status 
of 
a 
basic 
principle 
that 
might
underlie 
and 
explain 
the 
emergence 
of 
experience 
from 
the 
physical 
Experience 
arises 
by 
virtue 
of 
its 
status 
as 
one 
aspect 
of 
information 
when 
the 
other 
aspect 
is 
found 
embodied 
in 
physical 
processing
This 
principle 
is 
lent 
support 
by 
a 
number 
of 
consideration 
which 
I 
can 
only 
outline 
briefly 
here 
First 
consideration 
of 
the 
sort 
of 
physical 
changes 
that 
correspond 
to 
changes 
in 
conscious 
experience 
suggests 
that 
such 
changes 
are 
always 
relevant 
by 
virtue 
of 
their 
role 
in 
constituting 
informational 
changes
differences 
within 
an 
abstract 
space 
of 
states 
that 
are 
divided 
up 
precisely 
according 
to 
their 
causal 
differences 
along 
certain 
causal 
pathways 
Second 
if 
the 
principle 
of 
organizational 
invariance 
is 
to 
hold 
then 
we 
need 
to 
find 
some 
fundamental 
organizational 
property 
for 
experience 
to 
be 
linked 
to 
and 
information 
is 
an 
organizational 
property 
par 
excellence 
Third 
this 
principle 
offers 
some 
hope 
of 
explaining 
the 
principle 
of 
structural 
coherence 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
structure 
present 
within 
information 
spaces 
Fourth 
analysis 
of 
the 
cognitive 
explanation 
of 
our 
judgments 
and 
claims 
about 
conscious 
experience
judgments 
that 
are 
functionally 
explainable 
but 
nevertheless 
deeply 
tied 
to 
experience 
itself
suggests 
that 
explanation 
centrally 
involves 
the 
information 
states 
embedded 
in 
cognitive 
processing 
It 
follows 
that 
a 
theory 
based 
on 
information 
allows 
a 
deep 
coherence 
between 
the 
explanation 
of 
experience 
and 
the 
explanation 
of 
our 
judgments 
and 
claims 
about 
it
Wheeler 
1990 
has 
suggested 
that 
information 
is 
fundamental 
to 
the 
physics 
of 
the 
universe 
According 
to 
this 
it 
from 
bit 
doctrine
the 
laws 
of 
physics 
can 
be 
cast 
in 
terms 
of 
information 
postulating 
different 
states 
that 
give 
rise 
to 
different 
effects 
without 
actually 
saying 
what 
those 
states 
are 
It 
is 
only 
their 
position 
in 
an 
information 
space 
that 
counts
If 
so 
then 
information 
is 
a 
natural 
candidate 
to 
also 
play 
a 
role 
in 
a 
fundamental 
theory 
of 
consciousness
We 
are 
led 
to 
a 
conception 
of 
the 
world 
on 
which 
information 
is 
truly 
fundamental 
and 
on 
which 
it 
has 
two 
basic 
aspects 
corresponding 
to 
the 
physical 
and 
the 
phenomenal 
features 
of 
the 
world
Of 
course 
the 
double
aspect 
principle 
is 
extremely 
speculative 
and 
is 
also 
underdetermined 
leaving 
a 
number 
of 
key 
questions 
unanswered 
An 
obvious 
question 
is 
whether 
all 
information 
has 
a 
phenomenal 
aspect 
One 
possibility 
is 
that 
we 
need 
a 
further 
constraint 
on 
the 
fundamental 
theory 
indicating 
just 
what 
sort 
of 
information 
has 
a 
phenomenal 
aspect 
The 
other 
possibility 
is 
that 
there 
is 
no 
such 
constraint 
If 
not 
then 
experience 
is 
much 
more 
widespread 
than 
we 
might 
have 
believed 
as 
information 
is 
everywhere 
This 
is 
counterintuitive 
at 
first 
but 
on 
reflection 
I 
think 
the 
position 
gains 
a 
certain 
plausibility 
and 
elegance 
Where 
there 
is 
simple 
information 
processing 
there 
is 
simple 
experience 
and 
where 
there 
is 
complex 
information 
processing 
there 
is 
complex 
experience 
A 
mouse 
has 
a 
simpler 
information
processing 
structure 
than 
a 
human 
and 
has 
correspondingly 
simpler 
experience 
perhaps 
a 
thermostat 
a 
maximally 
simple 
information 
processing 
structure 
might 
have 
maximally 
simple 
experience 
Indeed 
if 
experience 
is 
truly 
a 
fundamental 
property 
it 
would 
be 
surprising 
for 
it 
to 
arise 
only 
every 
now 
and 
then 
most 
fundamental 
properties 
are 
more 
evenly 
spread 
In 
any 
case 
this 
is 
very 
much 
an 
open 
question 
but 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
position 
is 
not 
as 
implausible 
as 
it 
is 
often 
thought 
to 
be
Once 
a 
fundamental 
link 
between 
information 
and 
experience 
is 
on 
the 
table 
the 
door 
is 
opened 
to 
some 
grander 
metaphysical 
speculation 
concerning 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
world 
For 
example 
it 
is 
often 
noted 
that 
physics 
characterizes 
its 
basic 
entities 
only 
extrinsically 
in 
terms 
of 
their 
relations 
to 
other 
entities 
which 
are 
themselves 
characterized 
extrinsically 
and 
so 
on 
The 
intrinsic 
nature 
of 
physical 
entities 
is 
left 
aside 
Some 
argue 
that 
no 
such 
intrinsic 
properties 
exist 
but 
then 
one 
is 
left 
with 
a 
world 
that 
is 
pure 
causal 
flux 
a 
pure 
flow 
of 
information 
with 
no 
properties 
for 
the 
causation 
to 
relate
If 
one 
allows 
that 
intrinsic 
properties 
exist 
a 
natural 
speculation 
given 
the 
above 
is 
that 
the 
intrinsic 
properties 
of 
the 
physical
the 
properties 
that 
causation 
ultimately 
relates
are 
themselves 
phenomenal 
properties 
We 
might 
say 
that 
phenomenal 
properties 
are 
the 
internal 
aspect 
of 
information 
This 
could 
answer 
a 
concern 
about 
the 
causal 
relevance 
of 
experience
a 
natural 
worry 
given 
a 
picture 
on 
which 
the 
physical 
domain 
is 
causally 
closed 
and 
on 
which 
experience 
is 
supplementary 
to 
the 
physical 
The 
informational 
view 
allows 
us 
to 
understand 
how 
experience 
might 
have 
a 
subtle 
kind 
of 
causal 
relevance 
in 
virtue 
of 
its 
status 
as 
the 
intrinsic 
nature 
of 
the 
physical 
This 
metaphysical 
speculation 
is 
probably 
best 
ignored 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
developing 
a 
scientific 
theory 
but 
in 
addressing 
some 
philosophical 
issues 
it 
is 
quite 
suggestive
Conclusion
The 
theory 
I 
have 
presented 
is 
speculative 
but 
it 
is 
a 
candidate 
theory 
I 
suspect 
that 
the 
principles 
of 
structural 
coherence 
and 
organizational 
invariance 
will 
be 
planks 
in 
any 
satisfactory 
theory 
of 
consciousness
the 
status 
of 
the 
double
aspect 
theory 
of 
information 
is 
less 
certain 
Indeed
right 
now 
it 
is 
more 
of 
an 
idea 
than 
a 
theory 
To 
have 
any 
hope 
of 
eventual 
explanatory 
success 
it 
will 
have 
to 
be 
specified 
more 
fully 
and 
fleshed 
out 
into 
a 
more 
powerful 
form 
Still 
reflection 
on 
just 
what 
is 
plausible 
and 
implausible 
about 
it 
on 
where 
it 
works 
and 
where 
it 
fails 
can 
only 
lead 
to 
a 
better 
theory
Most 
existing 
theories 
of 
consciousness 
either 
deny 
the 
phenomenon 
explain 
something 
else 
or 
elevate 
the 
problem 
to 
an 
eternal 
mystery 
I 
hope 
to 
have 
shown 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
make 
progress 
on 
the 
problem 
even 
while 
taking 
it 
seriously 
To 
make 
further 
progress 
we 
will
need 
further 
investigation 
more 
refined 
theories 
and 
more 
careful 
analysis 
The 
hard 
problem 
is 
a 
hard 
problem 
but 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
to 
believe 
that 
it 
will 
remain 
permanently 
unsolved
