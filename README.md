# itdalu
itdalu or information that drifts and lingers under - is a work by artist Cameron Randall. The work investigates how an algorithm, when presented a text, re-represents that text as a digital image.

The text, Facing up to the Problem of Consciousness (1995), by philosopher David Chalmers, analyses the enigmatic quality of subjective conscious experience. Chalmers suggests that consciousness can be understood in two ways, the easy problem, phenomena that are functional or can be scientifically proven through neural or computational methods. And the hard problem, that of experience, the subjective nature in which we encounter phenomena.

In choosing Chalmers text, I see the work as a philosophical proposal, of how an algorithm, when presented a text, surrounding subjective experience, something itself is lacking, looks to represent this as a digital image. 

The three monitor installation is interconnected by cables that hang, loop and coil - each monitor presenting stages of the translation process: text to downloaded google images and subsequent transition to re-pixelated image.

The processing algorithm can be accessed and is available open source via this GitHub page. There is also a second link to the python script written by Hardik Vasa that enables the downloading of google images.

The artist would like to thank John Wild, Ben Alexander and Mayur Dave each who assisted in the coding process.
