# itdalu
itdalu or information that drifts and lingers under - is a work by artist Cameron Randall. The work is an investigation into how an algorithm, when presented a text, re-represents that text as a digital image. 

The text in question is an essay by philosopher David Chalmers titled Facing up to the Problem of Consciousness (1995). Chalmers analyses the ‘hard problem’ or what is understood better as the enigmatic quality of subjective conscious experience.

The three-screen installation looks to exhibit this translation: from text to bank of sourced google images, then to re-pixelated image.  

The processing algorithm can be accessed and is available open source via this GitHub page. There is also a second link to the python script written by Hardik Vasa that enables the downloading of google images. 

The artist would like to thank John Wild, Ben Alexander and Mayur Dave each who assisted the artist in the coding process.
