# itdalu
itdalu or information that drifts and lingers under - is a work by artist Cameron Randall. The work investigates how an algorithm, when presented a text, re-represents that text as a digital image. 

The text, Facing up to the Problem of Consciousness (1995), by philosopher David Chalmers, analyses the ‘hard problem’ or what is understood as the enigmatic quality of subjective experience.

The three monitor installation looks to present the translation of text to searched google images and subsequent transition to re-pixelated digital image.  

The processing algorithm can be accessed and is available open source via this GitHub page. There is also a second link to the python script written by Hardik Vasa that enables the downloading of google images. 

The artist would like to thank John Wild, Ben Alexander and Mayur Dave each who assisted the artist in the coding process.
